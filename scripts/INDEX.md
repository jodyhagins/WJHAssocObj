This is a very simple framework composed of C functions that extend the behavior of `objc_setAssociatedObject` and its counterparts.  Some folks see C APIs as anathema, so I have also included a category on `NSObject` that provides the same capabilities.

Really, there is no reason for something this small to warrant its own framework, but I wanted to experiment with both appledoc and carthage, and this provided that opportunity.

Furthermore, [this blog post](http://cocoaandgrits.blogspot.com/2015/08/associated-objects.html) explains in more depth the motivation and implementation of this associated objects API.

**Note:** This documentation was generated by a modified version of appledoc needed to better support code snippets and image links.  Until the pull requests are applied, you may grab the version I used [from here](https://github.com/jodyhagins/appledoc.git).
